# RZT aiOS Data transport methods

RZT aiOS blocks, irrespective of pre-built or custom, can be executed [either individually as a single block](https://ecstatic-jackson-f4a13a.netlify.app/docs/Quick-start-guides/create_block.md) or [as part of a pipeline](https://ecstatic-jackson-f4a13a.netlify.app/docs/Quick-start-guides/create_pipeline.md.)

Other aspects a user is concerned about while running a block is the execution environment and the mechanism by which data is moved from one block to next

In this document, we talk about different execution environments in details. To learn about different data transfer methods see [Data transport between blocks](https://ecstatic-jackson-f4a13a.netlify.app/docs/Quick-start-guides/data_transport.md)
